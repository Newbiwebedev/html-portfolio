<h1>The best movies according to Ray</h1>
<h2>My top 4 Movies</h2>
<p>(Disclaimer Nolan Dominates the list)</p>
<hr />
<h3>Interstellar</h3>
<p>Absolutely perfect......from cinematography to story to pacing. A must watch before you die.</p>
<h3>Inception</h3>
<p>The concept is very intriguing but very simple at the same time. Even though you know how the movie unfolds there is always a surprise. You can watch it as many times as you want without ever getting bored of it</p>
<h3>Blade Runner</h3>
<p>The best "Distopian World" movie ever. The story is heart suspenseful with an heart touching ending. However, that best feature of this movie is its cinematography with breathtaking scenes.</p>
<h3>Tennet</h3>
<p>You are always on the edge of your seat. The suspense never dies even after the movie ends. You need multiple watches to even begin to understand what is going on. It is not a leisure watch, Nolan demands the viewrs to realy pick their brains with this movie. Trust me it is absolutely worth it.</p>
<hr />
<p>All of the movies are of Sci-Fi genre. It is purely a coincidence..............I promise!</p>
